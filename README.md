# Simple-RPN-calculator
Nothing to do, a great day for programming!

Just playing around with QT6 and the QT Designer. I'm a big fan of RPN calculators, so I had a small goal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Best is to build a virtual environment, activate it and install it with 

pip install pyside6

to fulfil the dependencies.

It can only do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Don't expect too much...

It might be useful in a school context to explain RPN.

Have fun!
